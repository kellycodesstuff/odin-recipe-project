**REFLECTION**

This project was pretty straight forward and I was working on another HTML and CSS course concurrently so I felt like this was a great opportunity to practice applying the theory that I had learned.

This website didn't integrate any mobile-first design so one challenge that I ran into when I was QAing the site on a mobile device was the unwanted white space on the right hand side of the page. After a quick Google search, I was able to resolve the problem with the following addition of CSS code:

html,body {
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
    overflow-x:hidden;
    }
